EXERCISE 1 (THREE LOCATIONS IN THE FILE!!)
This is not the perspective projection using a and b.  Instead it is an orthographic projection.  It takes x to x, y to y, z=-near to z=-1 and z=-far to z=1.  It is a combination of a translation and a scale matrix.  Make sure your view2proj takes (1, 1, -2) to (1, 1, -1) and (1, 1, -10) to (1, 1, 1).

This transformation is not in the notes.  You already learned how to do this (for which transformation?).

Since we are moving the cube to (0, 0, -3), three units away from the eye, how does its appearance change?  (Hint:  trick question.)


EXERCISE 2 (TWO LOCATIONS)
We are moving the eye/camera now, not the object.  Since we are moving the eye, which way will ultimately cause the front of the object to hit the near plane and how many clicks?  Same question for rear plane?


EXERCISE 3
Similar.  Just remember the theory of relativity!


EXERCISE 4
It should be pretty obvious what "look at" should look like when you click it.  If you drag the object to the side or upper left or something, you are looking at it along a diagonal.  So when you look at it, it is farther away.  Eventually, it will disappear past the far plane unless you adjust with the z+ or z- buttons (which one?).


EXERCISE 5
You need to read cube.html and look at the slider printout to figure out how to set zoom.  How to use it should be obvious from the notes and the quiz.  We all know what zooming looks like.


EXERCISE 6
NOW do the perspective transformation.


EXERCISE 7
Until you do this exercise, dragging won't work quit right because you are dragging in front of or behind the object so perspective scale is wrong.
